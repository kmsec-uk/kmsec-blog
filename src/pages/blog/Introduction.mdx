Welcome to my blog. My 2023 New Year's resolution is to share more.

I've already imported an older write-up on ACME DNS challenge with Caddy, as well as some newer content I just got round to writing up.

This blog will hopefully cover a range of different topics. From detection engineering and analysis to threat intelligence.

## About the blog
This blog was built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), using a heavily modified [Astro Ink](https://github.com/one-aalam/astro-ink) theme.

Under the hood, it utilises [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for general styling.

[Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) is used for code-block styling and highlighting.

The header banner was generated with [BGjar](https://bgjar.com/).
